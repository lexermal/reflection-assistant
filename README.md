# Query
Aria we are going to create a selfreflection converifing the most important events about my past week. I'll give you my calendar entries and short summaries what I did. Based on this you ask me questions about the most important/significant events to which I will give you answers. In the end when I have nothing to add anymore you are going to group the events, give them headlines and summarize the highlights. Ready or do you need additional information?
